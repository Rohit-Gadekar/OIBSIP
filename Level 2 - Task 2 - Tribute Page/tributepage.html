            <p>
              Subhash Chandra Bose (23 January 1897 – 18 August 1945) was an
              Indian nationalist whose defiance of British authority in India
              made him a hero among many Indians, but his wartime alliances with
              Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan left a legacy vexed by
              authoritarianism, anti-Semitism, and military failure.

          Early life and education
        </h3>
        <ul class="py-4">
          <li type="1">
            Subhas Bose was born into wealth and privilege in a large Bengali
            family in Orissa during the British Raj. The early recipient of an
            Anglocentric education, he was sent after college to England to take
            the Indian Civil Service examination.
          </li>
          <li type="1">
            He succeeded with distinction in the vital first exam but demurred
            at taking the routine final exam, citing nationalism to be a higher
            calling. Returning to India in 1921, Bose joined the nationalist
            movement led by Mahatma Gandhi and the Indian National Congress.
          </li>
          <li type="1">Bose became Congress president in 1938.</li>

        <ul class="py-4">
          <li type="1">
            With Japanese support, Bose revamped the Indian National Army (INA),
            which comprised Indian prisoners of war of the Indian Army who had
            been captured by the Japanese in the Battle of Singapore.A
            Provisional Government of Free India was declared on the
            Japanese-occupied Andaman and Nicobar Islands and was nominally
            presided by Bose.
          </li>
          <li type="1">
            A 3,000-strong Free India Legion was recruited from among Indian
            POWs captured by Erwin Rommel's Afrika Korps to serve under Bose.
          </li>
          <li type="1">
            Bose's legacy is mixed. Among many in India, he is the muscular
            hero, his saga serving as a would-be counterpoise to the many
            actions of regeneration, negotiation, and reconciliation over a
            quarter-century through which the independence of India was
            achieved.

        <ul class="py-4">
          <li type="1">
            Subhas Chandra Bose was born to Prabhavati Bose (née Dutt) and
            Janakinath Bose on 23 January 1897 in Cuttack—in what is today the
            state of Odisha in India, but was then the Orissa Division of Bengal
            Province in British India.
          </li>
          <li type="1">
            Subhas was the ninth child and the sixth son. Jankinath, a
            successful lawyer and government pleader,[58] was loyal to the
            government of British India and scrupulous about matters of language
            and the law.
          </li>
          <li type="1">
            A self-made man from the rural outskirts of Calcutta, he had
            remained in touch with his roots, returning annually to his village
            during the pooja holidays.
          </li>
          <li type="1">
            Eager to join his five school-going older brothers, Subhas entered
            the Baptist Mission's Protestant European School in Cuttack in
            January 1902.

        <ul class="py-4">
          <li type="1">
            Subhas Chandra Bose's death occurred from third-degree burns on 18
            August 1945 after his overloaded Japanese plane crashed in
            Japanese-ruled Formosa (now Taiwan).
          </li>
          <li type="1">
            However, many among his supporters, especially in Bengal, refused at
            the time, and have refused since, to believe either the fact or the
            circumstances of his death. Conspiracy theories appeared within
            hours of his death and have thereafter had a long shelf life,
            keeping alive various martial myths about Bose.
